Welcome to Stair Chess!

Stair Chess is a chess playing program written in Scala.

This is being written as a Scala learning exercise. I am particularly interested in
suggestions on how the code can be made more functional and generally adopt a more
Scala orientated approach instead of the current Javaesque style.

This project is written using TDDD - TODO Driven Design.
