Expand the Move hierarchy by adding
  MovePieceTaking
  PromoteTaking
This will allow the condition logic in Configuration.applyMove in the MovePiece case to be eliminated.
The Promote case can also be simplified by not calling applyMove to determine if a piece was taken.
This is aimed at adding support to StandardMoveExplorer for providing a list of all possible legal moves instead of
using getBasicMoves which is incomplete because it does not include castling.

Add stalemate detection. Use this example of black in stalemate,
